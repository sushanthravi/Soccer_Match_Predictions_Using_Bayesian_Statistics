# Soccer_Match_Predictions_Using_Bayesian_Statistics
The project predicts English Premier League match outcomes using Bayesian Logistic Regression with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It models team strengths as coefficients to estimate home win probabilities from historical data. Insights include home-field advantages and team performance trends, showcasing Bayesian methods' value in sports analytics.


# English Premier League Match Outcome Prediction

This project uses **Bayesian Logistic Regression** to predict the outcomes of English Premier League matches. By leveraging **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)**, the model estimates the probability of a home team victory, providing insights into team performance and match dynamics.

## Features
- **Team Strengths as Coefficients**: Models the relative performance of home and away teams using historical match data, encoded with dummy variables.
- **Bayesian Framework**: Captures uncertainty in predictions with full posterior distributions of parameters.
- **Probabilistic Predictions**: Estimates probabilities of match outcomes (home win or not) with interpretable coefficients.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and standardized historical match data from multiple seasons, encoding team variables.
2. **Model Design**: Used Bayesian Logistic Regression with normal priors for coefficients and intercepts.
3. **Posterior Sampling**: Employed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) via the `brms` package in R for efficient posterior inference.
4. **Prediction**: Calculated match probabilities and log-odds for unseen test data.

## Insights
- **Home-Field Advantage**: Teams with strong home coefficients are more likely to win matches on home turf.
- **Away Performance**: Negative away coefficients highlight teams that struggle in away games.
- **Applications**: Valuable for sports analytics, betting strategies, and performance evaluation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R**: For Bayesian modeling and data analysis.
- **Stan**: Probabilistic programming for efficient HMC implementation.
- **ggplot2**: Visualizations for predictions, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional predictors like player statistics, recent form, or weather conditions.
- Extend to other leagues and refine the methodology for broader applications.
